The following code will help the users calculate the correct size of air conditioner for a specific room size. (1) The User would be first asked for their length and width of the room. (2) Then they would be given the three options to choose from about amount of shade they get in their room. (3) Based on the information given, the code would first calculate the area of the room, and then from the area, it would select the option for the amount of BTUs the room needs. (4) If your room recieves little shade, the it would increase the btu capacity by 15%, and if abundant shade, then it would decrease the btu needs by 10%. (5) Every information calculated would be given in the output of the program. Hope you like my program. Thank You.
